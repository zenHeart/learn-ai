# Code Review / Security Audit

## Overview

Review the current file for security and quality issues. Report findings only; do not modify code unless the user explicitly asks for fixes.

## Steps

1. **Security**
   - Check for sensitive data exposure, hardcoded secrets, or unsafe API usage
   - Note any dependency or input-validation concerns

2. **Quality**
   - Flag obvious bugs, missing error handling, or unclear logic
   - Suggest improvements only when asked

Report issues in a clear list. Do not apply changes unless the user requests it.
