* **Prompt**: Text input to the language model
* **LLM** (Large Language Model): Accepts input text and generates the most likely output. Besides ChatGPT, there are other [Large Language Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model#List_of_large_language_models), [Model Capabilities Comparison](https://www.superclueai.com/)

# [Machine Learning (ML)](https://easyai.tech/ai-definition/machine-learning/)
Machine Learning is the process where computers learn from large amounts of samples to accomplish specific goals, creating a mapping from A (input) -> B (output)
<!--
Handwritten digit recognition

Training set/Validation set/Test set
Features -> Identify digit features
Modeling -> The learning process
Model -> The patterns formed after training

 -->
  * **Training Set**
  * **Features**
  * **Modeling**
  * **Model**

> Through training data, continuously identifying features and modeling, finally forming an effective model - this process is called "machine learning"!

Three types based on training methods:
* [Supervised Learning](https://easyai.tech/ai-definition/supervised-learning/)
* [Unsupervised Learning](https://easyai.tech/ai-definition/unsupervised-learning/)
* [Reinforcement Learning](https://easyai.tech/ai-definition/reinforcement-learning/)

# Core Concepts for API Usage
* **[token](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction/key-concepts)**: Basic unit for model analysis, typically 4 characters or about 0.75 words. [Token calculator](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer)
* **[temperature](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create#completions/create-temperature)**: Controls randomness of output. Higher values mean more diverse answers, lower means more consistent. Range 0-2, typically set to 0.7. For knowledge Q&A, can be set to 0 for consistency.
* **[top_p](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create#completions/create-top_p)**: Range 0-1. Higher values mean more randomness, similar concept to temperature.
* **[max_tokens](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create#completions/create-max_tokens)**: Maximum output token limit. GPT-3.5 is approximately 8KB, newer versions approximately 16KB.
