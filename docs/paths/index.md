## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I skip paths?**
A: Yes, but we recommend Path 1 for everyone. Mastering AI coding tools is foundational for all AI development.

**Q: How much time per day do I need?**
A: 30-60 minutes/day is ideal. Consistency matters more than intensity.

**Q: Do I need a paid AI tool subscription?**
A: Path 1 requires a subscription (Cursor $20/mo or Copilot $10/mo). Paths 2-3 use pay-per-use APIs (~$5-20/mo for learning).

**Q: Are there assessments?**
A: Each path has self-assessment milestones. We'll add certification options in the future.

**Q: Can I learn in a team?**
A: Absolutely! We encourage team learning. Pair programming with AI tools is highly effective.
