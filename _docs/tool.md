## 1. Tool Positioning (What & Why)

<!--
Explain why you need this tool, not just what features it has.
Key questions to answer:
- In what scenarios do users encounter problems?
- What core pain points does this tool solve?
-->

- <!-- Describe the core problem this tool solves -->
- <!-- List 2–3 typical use cases -->
- <!-- Clarify scenarios where it's not applicable or not recommended, to avoid misuse -->


## 2. Quick Start

<!--
Goal: Get users "up and running" in the shortest time possible,
without understanding principles or complex configurations.
-->

- <!-- Installation method and environment requirements -->
- <!-- Initialization or startup steps -->
- <!-- Minimal runnable example (Hello World / basic command) -->
- <!-- Success criteria: How users can confirm they're using it correctly -->


## 3. Core Concepts

<!--
Introduce only the minimal concept set needed to understand the tool.
Avoid concept overload; one sentence per concept is sufficient.
-->

- **Concept A**: <!-- The role and responsibility of this concept -->
- **Concept B**: <!-- The role and responsibility of this concept -->
- **Concept C**: <!-- The role and responsibility of this concept -->


## 4. Basic Usage Patterns

<!--
Start from user tasks, not from APIs or features.
-->

- <!-- Common task types (e.g., view / modify / execute / analyze) -->
- <!-- Recommended standard workflow -->
- <!-- Most common mistakes and precautions for beginners -->

---

## 5. Advanced Usage

<!--
For users who have completed basic usage.
Explain more complex or higher-value usage methods.
-->

- <!-- Complex or combined usage scenarios -->
- <!-- Recommendations regarding performance, stability, or maintainability -->
- <!-- Integration methods with existing toolchains or workflows -->

---

## 6. Limitations & Boundaries

<!--
Clarify what the tool "cannot do" to help users set realistic expectations.
-->

- <!-- Known limitations -->
- <!-- High-risk or not recommended scenarios -->
- <!-- Risk mitigation or fallback suggestions -->

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

<!--
Organize common issues based on real usage experience.
-->

- <!-- Common problem descriptions -->
- <!-- Problem causes or troubleshooting approaches -->
- <!-- Corresponding solutions or alternative approaches -->

---

## 8. Learning Path & References

<!--
Provide further learning direction for users at different stages.
-->

- <!-- Beginner stage: What to learn next -->
- <!-- Proficiency stage: Improve efficiency or depth of usage -->
- <!-- In-depth stage: Principles, architecture, or advanced practices -->
- <!-- Official documentation / community resource links -->
